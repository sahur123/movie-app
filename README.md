# movie-app
This is the basic app showing popular movies. The app fetches the movie data from an free movie api. The app is made using HTML, CSS and JS and uses concepts like Fetch API and DOM manipulation.
This is the perfect for beginners who want to understand some javascript concepts and populating the data from api into front end ui.
Visit the below link to see the app. This is surely the version 1 for the app. You can add more functionality into it and which I will do too.</br>
